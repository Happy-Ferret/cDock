Version		: 8.2
Build date	: Jul / 13 / 2015
------------------------------------------------

8.3

- Fix cDock not opening on guest accounts
- Fix some settings not applying on standard accounts
- Fix not restarting TotalFinder when making changes to Finder
- Password window cancel button
- Test 10.11 support * 

* Note this just replaces 10.11 Dock with 10.10 Dock 
any new functionality of 10.11 will be lost
this is probably as good of a workaround as I'll do
even though it seems to totally break guest accounts
