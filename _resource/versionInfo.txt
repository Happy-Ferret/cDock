------------------------------------------------

Version		: 8.4
Build date	: SOMETIME / SOMETIME / 2015

------------------------------------------------

- 10.11 support (that's not terrible! ðŸ™Œ)
	- 10.11 requires that SIP aka "rootless" be
	turned off during the initial install for
	SIMBL and Opee

- Dock customization changes (10.9 > 10.11)
	Additions:
	- customize application indicators
	- customize label background
	- icon reflections (similar to 10.9 and below)
	- icon shadows
	- darken icons on mouse over
	- option to show blurred glass layer
	
	Improved:
	- hide labels
	- picture themes use 2 background images so your 
	theme can have a horizontal and vertical image

	Removed: (temporarily)
	- background border layer 
	- freely resize background
	- customizable separator

	Issues:
	- icon reflections and icon shadows will not show
	until dock is resized. you can resize the dock
	by grabbing the separator area and dragging.
