### Information:
* cDock installs [SIMBL](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) if it is not already installed.
* cDock works for both the Bottom Dock and Side dock.
* cDock theming requires OS X 10.9+.
* Not all features are available on all versions of OS X
* cDock may break in the future, and I'm not obligated to fix it, be careful when updating.
	* Working on:
	    * **10.9** to **10.9.5**
	    * **10.10** to **10.10.5**
	    * **10.11**
* [Donate](http://w0lfschild.github.io/pages/donate.html)

### Note:
* This project isn't meant to be downloaded and built, the UI is hacked together with a combination of Pashua and Platypus. This is more of a hosting / distribution for the project
* The bundle that actually controls the dock can be found here : [cDock2](http://github.com/w0lfschild/cDock2)
